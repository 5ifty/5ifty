### Welcome to my profile! 

### &#128172; About me:
My names Harry, I mainly use python for my personal projects, but also have a background in HTML, CSS and a bit of Js.

My main areas of focus is backend development and data-handling which you can see within my CSGO API Handler and other upcoming projects.

Some of my main projects include: Raccoonbot.py which I have now made open source for everyone to look at and host locally if they please.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making a portfolio website to showcase my abilities.
